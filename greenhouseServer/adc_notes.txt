ADC Wiring for capacitance sensor

Supply: 3.29V

Wires:
A0 Blue:  CH1: 0-26344
A1 Yellow: CH2: 0-26346
A2 Green:  CH3: 0-26346
A3 White:  CH0: 0-26346

So ADC works, but the software channel numbers are different to the labels
on the PCB.

Set Gain to 2/3 rather than 1 - this got the ADC on range so it now
responds to changes.

With sensor dry, indicated value is 19420.
In damp soil, indicated value is ~19000
Very wet soil ~18000

Soil  : Sensor 4
Soil1 : Sensor 1
Soil2 : Sensor 2
Soil3 : Sensr 3

Switched to use arduino nano (=10 bit ADC) because had loads of trouble
with ADS1115.....
Capacitance probes:
Damp soil: 460-650
Air: 790
Ground: 0
VCC: 1023
Condy meter 200 uC at same time.

19:51Set to water 10 sec in 60 sec cycle to try to increase reading....
